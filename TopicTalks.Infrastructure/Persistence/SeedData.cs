This approach, inspired by functional programming, allows for more expressive and type-driven code, making it easier to add new rules or modify existing ones without extensive refactoring. However, the immutability of records may introduce overhead in scenarios where mutable objects are preferred, potentially affecting performance. Despite this, the benefits of using records, such as improved code clarity and built-in support for value-based equality, often outweigh the performance considerations, especially in projects that prioritize immutability and pattern matching.", UserId = 2, CreatedAt = DateTime.Now },
